# Cplus
files for C and C++ so average of those is C+ ig.

# Coding style
I follow the linux kernel coding style word-for-word: 8-width tabs and K&R style braces.

Recently(2022-03-05 01:12 IST at the time of me starting to write this), I've been getting back into learning C because i like the simplicity over C++(or most other languages for that matter). I don't dislike C++; I understand why it was created.

I wanted to learn C because of how close it was to the machine. Most operating systems are written in it, including linux, which I currently use. I've also been charmed by the automaton-like feeling of assembly(to which C brings me much closer to understanding) with some help from [Tsoding](https://www.youtube.com/c/TsodingDaily) and [his ongoing series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpM-Dvs8t0VbMZA7wW9aR3EtBqe2kinu4) where he builds a compiler for his own programming language from scratch.

I'll try not to turn into one of those madmen who switch to gentoo/lfs, or worse write my own OS(I'm staring at you Terry A. Davis), not because I won't like to be that way, but because CS is not my only ambition in life.
